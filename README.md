### Axios
In this project I needed to use a tool to consume and display data from an API. There are several ways to do this, but the most popular way is using axios, an HTTP client based on Promises.

### Styled Components
To style our components I used a library called [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics). It is a library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application. They are written in a mixture of JavaScript and CSS

### Tests Unit
This project was done using unit tests.
Because it is cheaper and faster to make, and they guarantee a solid base for the system.
